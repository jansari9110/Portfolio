        I have successfully completed the <strong>Pre Security learning path </strong>strong> on TryHackMe, which provided me with a strong foundational understanding of cybersecurity concepts and system fundamentals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this path, I gained hands-on exposure to <strong>how computers, networks, and operating systems work from a security perspective.</strong> I developed a clear understanding of networking basics, the internet model, Linux fundamentals, Windows internals, and introductory security concepts, which are essential before moving into offensive or defensive security roles.
